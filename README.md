Simple AI to create a fully connected map on a grid

NOTE - omitting original Node.java file created for this project. That path was not followed, so it should be obsolete in terms of where the project is

Large portion of this project uses a theme I call infecting.

  Infecting uses unique variables and thus allows the program to determine when the infection is complete by having every single tile infected.
